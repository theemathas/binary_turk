# Binary Turk
A UCI (Universal Chess Interface) chess engine written in rust

This is work in progress, but it already works and makes pretty reasonable moves.

Like all UCI engines, this program needs a GUI, such as xboard, knights, or eboard. However, this program is tested only on xboard (which is an old program), since I cannot get the other knights or eboard to work on my machine
