# Binary Turk

A UCI (Universal Chess Interface) chess engine written in the Rust programming
language

It is not perfect, but it works and makes pretty reasonable moves.

Like all UCI engines, this program needs a GUI, such as Xboard, Winboard,
Knights, Eboard, or Fritz. However, this program is currently tested only on
xboard (which is an old program), since I cannot get the other programs to work
on my computer.

This program is licensed under the MIT license.
