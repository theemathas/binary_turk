# Binary Turk

A UCI (Universal Chess Interface) chess engine written in the Rust programming language

This is work in progress, but it already works and makes pretty reasonable moves.

Like all UCI engines, this program needs a GUI, such as xboard, winboard, knights, or eboard. However, this program is currently tested only on xboard (which is an old program), since I cannot get the other programs to work on my computer.

This program is licensed under the MIT license.
